I get asked a lot of questions, by a lot of people in my life as well as complete
strangers, so I thought I'd make things easier for people and make an AMA rig out of
github's issues system! And, when I say ask me anything, I do mean *anything*: personal
questions, programming questions, questions about love, life, help with your homework.

***Anything***.

Guidelines:
-----------

- Read the `:memo: Answered Q's`_ and `:interrobang: Unanswered Q's`_ before posting,
  to be sure your question hasn't been asked/answered already!
- Be direct and succinct. I have to understand what you want me to answer.
- Be civil and polite; otherwise, I most certainly will not be, either.
